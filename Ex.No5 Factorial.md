### DATE: 12/09/2025                                                                       
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212223040087
### AIM: 
To  write  a logic program for finding the factorial of given number using SWI-PROLOG. 
### Algorithm:
1. STEP 1: Start the program
2. STEP 2:  Write a rules for finding factorial of given program in SWI-PROLOG.
3.   a)	factorial of 0 is 1 => written as factorial(0,1).
4.   b)	factorial of number greater than 0 obtained by recursively calling the factorial    function.
5. STEP 3: Run the program  to find answer of  query.
6. STEP 4: Stop the program.

### Program:
```
factorial(0,1).
factorial(A,B) :-
    A > 0,
    C is A-1,
    factorial(C,D),
    B is A*D.
```

### Result:
Thus the factorial of given number was found by logic programming.
